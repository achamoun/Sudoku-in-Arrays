# Sudoku-in-Arrays
Evaluating a Sudoku represented in one or two dimensional arrays. 
Notice the difference between iterating and finding out elements between one or more dimensional arrays.

Iterating in a one dimensional array is geometrically easy (one loop) but finding out elements is algebraically complex (indexes of elements)

Iterating in a two dimensional array is geometrically complex (two loops) but finding out elements is algebraically easy (indexes of elements)
